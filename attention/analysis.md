# Analysis

## Layer 6, Head 10 

This attention head appears to focus on adjectives and the nouns they modify. It seems to identify how descriptive words relate to the nouns they qualify, enhancing the understanding of the characteristics being described

Example Sentences:
- The bright sun shone down on the beach.
- She wore a beautiful dress to the party.

In these examples, the head pays attention from the adj {"bright", "beautiful"} to the nouns {"sun", "dress"} they modify, indicating a learned relationship that connects descriptors to the objects they characterize. 

## Layer 3, Head 10

This attention head seems to focus on the relationship between verbs and their direct objects. It appears to track which objs are associated with specific actions, emphasize the dependency between the verbs and the nouns they act upon.

Example Sentences:
- The chef cooked the pasta.
- The dog chased the ball.

In both sentences, the head shows strong attention from the verb ("cooked" and "chased") to the corresponding direct objects ("pasta" and "ball"). This suggests that the head effectively learns to recognize the action-object relationship.
