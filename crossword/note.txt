The unary constraint on a variable is given by its length.

The binary constraints on a variable are given by its overlap with neighboring variables. 
For each pair of neighboring variables, those variables share an overlap: a single square 
that is common to them both. 
We can represent that overlap as the character index in each variable’s word that must be the same character. 

For this problem, we’ll add the additional constraint that all words must be different: 
the same word should not be repeated multiple times in the puzzle.
